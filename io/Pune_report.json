Because the plot is smaller than 1001 sq. m, a separate recreational open space is not required, but you must plant at least one tree for every 100 sq. m of your plot area.\n\n**Source:** The summary above is based on the official rules found at the following points in the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034 document: `['PART - V, Sr No. I, sub-point iii', 'PART - IV, sub-point (i)', 'PART - IV, sub-point (f)(b)']`",
