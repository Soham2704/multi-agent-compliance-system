The specific zoning of the plot (e.g., Residential R1/R2, Tourism Development Zone, Afforestation Zone) as per the official Development Plan is crucial as it governs permissible uses and may alter FSI calculations.\n*   **Proposed Building Use:** It is essential to specify if the building will be purely residential or will have mixed-use (e.g., commercial shops on the ground floor), as this directly impacts the required front setback.\n*   **Proposed Building Height:** If you plan to build higher than the standard 8 meters, the setback requirements will change and need to be re-evaluated based on other regulations not fully detailed in the context.\n*   **Plot Deductions:** Confirmation is needed on whether any portion of the 800 sq. m. plot is affected by deductions for road widening, Development Plan (DP) roads, or other public reservations. Such deductions would reduce the net plot area used for FSI calculations.\n*   **Plot Type:** Clarification on whether the plot is an internal plot, a corner plot, or part of a row-housing scheme is needed, as this can affect setback rules.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n*   **Verify Official Zoning:** Obtain the official Development Plan sheet for your area to confirm the precise zoning and any reservations applicable to your plot.\n*   **Finalize Building Use:** Decide on the exact use of the proposed building to determine the correct setback and other applicable regulations.\n*   **Engage a Professional:** Consult a licensed local architect or engineer. They can prepare a detailed site plan and the required area statement as per \"PROFORMA - I\" for submission to the PMRDA.\n*   **Explore FSI Potential:** Discuss with your consultant the feasibility and cost-benefit of acquiring additional FSI through premium payment or TDR if you wish to construct a larger built-up area than the basic 880 sq. m.", "entitlement_calculation": {"input_rule": "road_width_gt_18m_bonus", "rule_value": 0.5, "explanation": "The rule 'road_width_gt_18m_bonus' corresponds to a value of 0.5."}, "envelope_calculation": {"inputs": {"plot_area": 800, "setback_area": 150}, "formula": "allowable_envelope = plot_area - (setback_area * 2)", "calculation": "500 = 800 - (150 * 2)", "result": 500}, "rl_optimal_action": 0}}
