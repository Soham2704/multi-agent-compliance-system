        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** October 06, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n*   **Plot Size:** 1200 sq. m.\n*   **Location Type:** suburban\n*   **Abutting Road Width:** 12 m.\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\nBased on the provided data, a set of development rules pertaining to Floor Space Index (FSI), setbacks, and mandatory amenity space has been identified. However, the rule set contains multiple, conflicting values without specifying the conditions under which each rule applies.\n\nSpecifically, there are three different standards for front/all-around setbacks:\n*   Front Setback: 1.5 m\n*   Front Setback: 3.0 m (part of a comprehensive rule set)\n*   Minimum Setback on All Sides: 6.0 m\n\nThe lack of conditional logic (e.g., rules based on plot size, land use, or road width) makes it impossible to definitively select the correct regulation. For the purpose of this report, we will proceed with an analysis based on the most comprehensive rule found, which includes FSI and detailed setbacks. This is a working assumption that requires verification.\n\n**Assumed Applicable Rule Set for Calculation:**\n*   **Base FSI:** 1.0\n*   **Premium FSI:** 0.3\n*   **Fungible FSI:** 0.3\n*   **Setbacks:** 3.0 m (Front), 2.25 m (Side), 2.25 m (Rear)\n*   **Required Amenity Space:** 12% of Plot Area\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\nThe following calculations are based on the assumed rule set detailed above.\n\n**A. Floor Space Index (FSI) & Permissible Built-Up Area**\n\nFSI determines the total buildable area as a multiple of the plot area. The total potential FSI is the sum of Base, Premium, and Fungible components.\n\n*   **Base FSI:** 1.0\n*   **Premium FSI:** 0.3 (Typically available upon payment of a premium fee)\n*   **Fungible FSI:** 0.3 (Compensatory area, often for balconies, voids, etc.)\n*   **Total Potential FSI:** 1.0 (Base) + 0.3 (Premium) + 0.3 (Fungible) = **1.6**\n\n*   **Base Permissible Built-Up Area:**\n    `Plot Size \u00d7 Base FSI = 1200 sq. m. \u00d7 1.0 = 1200 sq. m.`\n\n*   **Total Potential Built-Up Area (with all FSI components):**\n    `Plot Size \u00d7 Total FSI = 1200 sq. m. \u00d7 1.6 = 1920 sq. m.`\n\n**B. Setbacks**\n\nSetbacks are mandatory open spaces required between the building and the plot boundary.\n\n*   **Front Setback:** 3.0 m\n*   **Side Setbacks:** 2.25 m (on each side)\n*   **Rear Setback:** 2.25 m\n\n**Note:** These values are in direct conflict with other rules specifying a 1.5 m front setback or a 6.0 m all-around setback. The actual buildable footprint on the ground depends on which rule is applicable and the plot's dimensions.\n\n**C. Required Amenity Space**\n\nThis is the required percentage of the plot to be reserved for recreational or landscaped open space (LOS).\n\n*   **Required Amenity Space Percentage:** 12%\n*   **Required Amenity Space Area:**\n    `Plot Size \u00d7 12% = 1200 sq. m. \u00d7 0.12 = 144 sq. m.`\n\nThis area must be provided as unencumbered open space, typically at ground level.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\nA definitive analysis is not possible without the following critical information:\n\n1.  **Rule Applicability Conditions:** The primary missing information is the context for the rules. We need to know which specific conditions (e.g., land use zone, building height, plot area threshold, road width) trigger each of the conflicting setback and FSI regulations. The \"suburban\" location type is too generic.\n2.  **Plot Dimensions and Shape:** The plot size is known (1200 sq. m.), but its dimensions (e.g., 30m x 40m vs. 20m x 60m) are not. Plot dimensions are essential for calculating the buildable ground footprint after applying the setback distances.\n3.  **Proposed Land Use:** The intended use of the property (e.g., single-family residential, apartment complex, commercial office, mixed-use) is unknown. Regulations for FSI, setbacks, parking, and amenity space often vary significantly based on land use.\n4.  **Conditions for Premium & Fungible FSI:** The rules do not specify the procedure, cost, or requirements for availing the additional 0.3 Premium FSI and 0.3 Fungible FSI.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\nTo move forward and obtain a conclusive understanding of the development potential, we recommend the following actions:\n\n1.  **Consult the Local Planning Authority:** Contact the municipal planning or building department to clarify which specific development control regulations apply to your plot, given its size, location, and abutting road width. This will resolve the conflict in the provided rules.\n2.  **Obtain a Certified Survey Plan:** Commission a licensed surveyor to create a detailed drawing of the plot, showing its exact dimensions, shape, orientation, and any existing features.\n3.  **Define Project Use Case:** Determine the specific type of development you wish to pursue (e.g., residential apartments, commercial building) as this will be a key factor in identifying the applicable rules.\n4.  **Engage a Local Architect/Planner:** A local professional will have experience navigating the specific municipal regulations, can provide an accurate feasibility study based on confirmed rules, and can advise on the process for utilizing premium FSI.\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based solely on the structured data provided in the `<context>`.
