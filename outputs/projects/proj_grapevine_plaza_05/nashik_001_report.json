        "analysis_summary": "### **AI Consultant Report: Planning & Zoning Analysis**\n**Date:** October 06, 2025\n**Subject:** Analysis of Development Potential\n**Case Parameters:**\n*   **Plot Size:** 1200\n*   **Location Type:** suburban\n*   **Abutting Road Width:** 12\n---\n#### **1. Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\nThe provided context contains several key development parameters, including Floor Space Index (FSI), setback requirements, and mandatory amenity space. However, the rules present significant conflicts and ambiguities that prevent a definitive analysis.\n\n**Key Applicable Parameters Identified:**\n*   **Floor Space Index (FSI):** A set of rules provides for a Base FSI of 1.0, a Premium FSI of 0.3, and a Fungible FSI of 0.3. This allows for a total potential FSI of 1.6.\n*   **Setbacks:** Multiple conflicting rules for setbacks were found:\n    *   Front Setback: Rules specify 1.5m, 3.0m, and a minimum of 6.0m on all sides.\n    *   Side & Rear Setbacks: Rules specify 2.25m for side and rear, which conflicts with the rule requiring a minimum of 6.0m on all sides.\n*   **Amenity Space:** A clear requirement for 12% of the plot area to be reserved as amenity space was identified.\n\n**Primary Issue:** The lack of conditional logic makes it impossible to determine which of the conflicting setback rules applies to this specific plot. For this report, calculations will be based on the most detailed rule set (`front_setback_m: 3.0`, `side_setback_m: 2.25`, `rear_setback_m: 2.25`), but this is a critical assumption that must be verified.\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\nThe following calculations are based on the assumption that the most comprehensive rule set is applicable and that the plot size is in square meters.\n\n**A. Floor Space Index (FSI) & Buildable Area**\n*   **Base FSI:** 1.0\n*   **Premium FSI:** 0.3\n*   **Fungible FSI:** 0.3\n*   **Total Potential FSI:** Base + Premium + Fungible = 1.0 + 0.3 + 0.3 = **1.6**\n*   **Total Potential Buildable Area:** Plot Size \u00d7 Total FSI\n    *   1200 sq. m. \u00d7 1.6 = **1920 sq. m.**\n\n**B. Amenity Space (Landscaped Open Space - LOS)**\n*   **Required Amenity Space Percentage:** 12%\n*   **Required Amenity Space Area:** Plot Size \u00d7 12%\n    *   1200 sq. m. \u00d7 0.12 = **144 sq. m.**\n    *   This area must be reserved on the plot for amenities as per regulations.\n\n**C. Building Footprint & Setbacks**\n*   **Assumed Setbacks (from the most detailed rule):**\n    *   Front: 3.0 m\n    *   Side (Each): 2.25 m\n    *   Rear: 2.25 m\n*   **Note on Conflicting Rule:** A separate rule mandates a `min_setback_all_sides_m: 6`. If this rule were to apply, it would drastically reduce the buildable ground coverage compared to the assumption used here.\n*   **Limitation:** The exact buildable ground area (footprint) cannot be calculated without the plot's specific dimensions (length and width).\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\nA definitive analysis is not possible due to the following missing information:\n1.  **Rule Applicability Criteria:** The context lacks the conditions (e.g., plot size thresholds, road width triggers, location-specific clauses) that determine which of the conflicting setback rules applies. This is the most critical missing piece of information.\n2.  **Plot Dimensions:** The length and width of the 1200 sq. m. plot are required to calculate the precise building footprint after applying setbacks. A 30m x 40m plot will have a different buildable footprint than a 20m x 60m plot.\n3.  **Conditions for Premium/Fungible FSI:** The rules do not specify the process, costs (e.g., premium charges), or prerequisites for utilizing the available Premium and Fungible FSI.\n4.  **Definition of Amenity Space:** The regulations need to be checked for specific requirements regarding the 12% amenity space, such as whether it must be at ground level, its minimum dimensions, or if it can overlap with setback areas.\n5.  **Units of Measurement:** The report assumes all units are in meters (m) and square meters (sq. m.). This should be formally confirmed.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\nTo proceed with development planning, the following actions are recommended:\n1.  **Clarify Governing Regulations:** Consult the official municipal development control regulations or a local planning authority to determine the exact setback rules applicable to a 1200 sq. m. suburban plot fronting a 12 m road. This will resolve the primary conflict identified in this report.\n2.  **Obtain Plot Survey/Dimensions:** Secure a formal survey report or architectural drawing that provides the precise length and width of the property.\n3.  **Investigate FSI Charges:** Contact the municipal planning department to understand the financial implications and application process for availing the Premium and Fungible FSI.\n4.  **Perform a Feasibility Study:** Once the correct rules are identified and plot dimensions are known, conduct a detailed architectural feasibility study to determine the optimal building design, ground coverage, and unit layout.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based on the structured data provided in the `<context>`. The identified rules may be incomplete or part of a larger, more complex regulatory document. The analysis contains assumptions due to conflicting information.
