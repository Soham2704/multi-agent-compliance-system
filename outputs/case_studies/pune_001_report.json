Analysis Summary & Applicable Rules**\n\nBased on the provided parameters, the database search yielded a limited set of applicable development rules. The only regulations identified pertain to mandatory minimum setbacks (margins) from the plot boundaries.\n\n*   **Front Margin:** 3.0 meters\n*   **Side Margins:** 1.5 meters (assumed for each side)\n*   **Rear Margin:** 1.5 meters\n\nCrucially, no rules were found regarding the most significant development controls, such as Floor Space Index (FSI) or Floor Area Ratio (FAR), maximum permissible ground coverage, or building height limitations. The absence of this information means that while we can calculate the potential building footprint area, we cannot determine the total permissible built-up area or the number of floors allowed. The analysis is therefore incomplete and preliminary.\n\n#### **2. Entitlements & Calculations**\n\nThe identified entitlements are the setback requirements, which define the buildable area envelope on the plot.\n\n**A. Setback Requirements:**\n*   **Front Setback:** 3.0 m\n*   **Side Setback:** 1.5 m\n*   **Rear Setback:** 1.5 m\n\n**B. Buildable Area Calculation:**\nTo illustrate the impact of these setbacks, we must assume a plot shape. Assuming a regular square plot for calculation purposes:\n\n1.  **Plot Area:** 800 sq m\n2.  **Assumed Plot Dimensions (Square):**\n    *   Side Length = \u221a800 \u2248 28.28 meters\n    *   Dimensions \u2248 28.28 m x 28.28 m\n3.  **Calculation of Buildable Dimensions:**\n    *   **Buildable Width:** 28.28 m (Total Width) - 1.5 m (Side 1) - 1.5 m (Side 2) = **25.28 m**\n    *   **Buildable Depth:** 28.28 m (Total Depth) - 3.0 m (Front) - 1.5 m (Rear) = **23.78 m**\n4.  **Maximum Buildable Footprint Area (Ground Coverage):**\n    *   Buildable Area = Buildable Width \u00d7 Buildable Depth\n    *   Buildable Area = 25.28 m \u00d7 23.78 m \u2248 **601.16 sq m**\n\nThis calculation represents the maximum area on the ground floor that a structure could occupy. The total legally permissible built-up area across all floors is currently unknown.\n\n#### **3. Key Missing Information**\n\nA definitive analysis is not possible without the following critical information. The term \"suburban\" is a general descriptor and not a legal jurisdiction.\n\n1.  **Specific Jurisdiction:** The exact city, county, or municipality is required, as regulations are highly localized.\n2.  **Zoning Designation:** The official zoning code for the plot (e.g., R-1 Single-Family Residential, C-2 General Commercial, MU-N Mixed-Use Neighborhood) is the most critical factor, as it governs use, density, and form.\n3.  **Proposed Use:** The intended use of the property (e.g., single-family home, apartment building, retail store, office) determines which specific sections of the zoning code apply.\n4.  **Governing Regulations:** Key development controls that were not found in the database search:\n    *   **Floor Space Index (FSI) or Floor Area Ratio (FAR):** This ratio dictates the total buildable square footage relative to the plot size.\n    *   **Maximum Ground Coverage (%):** A rule that may further limit the calculated 601.16 sq m footprint.\n    *   **Maximum Building Height:** A limit expressed in meters or number of stories.\n    *   **Parking Requirements:** Mandated number of parking spaces based on the proposed use and size.\n5.  **Plot Dimensions and Shape:** The actual geometry of the plot is needed for an accurate buildable area calculation.\n6.  **Easements & Covenants:** Any legal restrictions on the property title that could limit development.\n\n#### **4. Recommended Next Steps**\n\nTo proceed with evaluating the development potential of this plot, we recommend the following actions:\n\n1.  **Refine Your Query:** Obtain the \"Key Missing Information\" listed in Section 3, particularly the specific municipal jurisdiction and the property's exact zoning designation. A new query with this data will yield far more accurate results.\n2.  **Consult Local Authorities:** Contact the Planning, Zoning, or Building Department of the relevant municipality. They are the definitive source for all applicable regulations, zoning maps, and development standards.\n3.  **Engage a Professional:** For a formal and legally sound assessment, consult with a local professional such as a licensed architect, certified planner, or a land-use attorney. They can provide a comprehensive feasibility study, navigate the local permitting process, and interpret the nuances of the development code.\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** This report is an automated analysis based on the limited data provided and the rules found in our database.
